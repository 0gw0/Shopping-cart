# Shopping Cart[^1].

A React project to practice:
  - array.reduce
  - useReducer
  - useEffect
  - useContext

### What does this do?

It renders a shopping cart with the total amount of items that is currently in the cart and the total price of all the items.

The item amount can be toggled and the  total price and total amount of items in the cart with be updated.
